>The ultimate shell tool to create an Alternate Boot Environment in linux  (Optimised for redhat 7 and later)

Originally introduced on Solaris systems (because the ZFS file system supports clone and snapshots which makes it possible to create a full copy of the system disk), the Alternate Boot remains less known in the Linux world.
This document allows to understand the functioning of the BootAlt script library, offers the system administrator the elements to easily control the implementation of an alternative Boot environment on Linux systems (Redhat like).

Doc in Progress ....
